To make this syllabus, I consulted lots of courses from many instructors who graciously made their syllabi public and shared links on Twitter. I include links to those syllabi below, as both a way of acknowledging their help and as a resource for future DH syllabus construction.

I also want to thank the many people from whom I got advice and inspiration for this course, including Doug Knox, Steve Pentecost, Whitney Trettien, Scott Weingart, Alison Langmead, Matt Lavin, Melanie Walsh, Dan Sinykin, Wendy Wall, Joe Loewenstein, Meredith Kelling, and Anna Preus.
