Like the week when we discussed statistical modeling, this week you'll read through [this Jupyter notebook on web scraping and APIs](https://jrladd.com/web_data). It includes some hands-on work you'll do on the command line, but mostly this is a chance for you to understand a little bit more about how the web works and to have some techniques on hand for future projects.
