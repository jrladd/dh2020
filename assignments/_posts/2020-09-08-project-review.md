Choose one of the projects, tools, archives, or publications in the *Explore* section of our [Course Schedule](/schedule) and write a short review, no more than 1500 words. You might look at some of the essays at [*Reviews in DH*](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/) as examples. You can follow their Overview/Review format or write a more continuous piece.

Here are some questions you might ask as you prepare your review:

- What is the history of this project? Who made it and what questions were they trying to answer?
- How does this project fit into current DH conversations? What scholarly genres does it take up?
- What does this project do especially well? What techniques does it deploy effectively?
- What are the gaps or blindspots of this project? How might it improve?

A good review will both assess and contextualize a project, helping the reader to understand its effectiveness within a broader DH landscape.

You may complete this assignment **at any point during the quarter**. I want to give you extra flexibility in what will surely be a hectic and difficult term. You can turn in this assignment at any time via email, and you can review a project from any week of the class. However, keep in mind that you'll also have to complete the analysis proposal and the final project, so you may not want to save everything for the end of the quarter.
